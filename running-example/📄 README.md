# Running Example

This folder contains a running example to demonstrate the core methods proposed in the paper *Advancing Object-Centric Process Mining with Multi-Dimensional Data Operations*. The example showcases how multi-dimensional operations such as drill-down, roll-up, fold, and unfold can enhance the analysis of object-centric event logs.
